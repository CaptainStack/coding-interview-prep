# Coding Interview Prep
This is a public repository where I implement solutions to coding interview questions. Many are problems from [Cracking the Coding Interview] (https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1487198960&sr=8-1&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview), but I've also included problems my friends have thrown at me for practice, and problems I've been asked to implement in real-world interviews. These solutions are all written in JavaScript for now. Please feel free to use the problems and solutions for your own purposes.

I am currently looking for work, so if you like what you see, feel free to contact me (andre.stackhouse@outlook.com).
